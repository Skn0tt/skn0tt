*Hi there, i'm Simon ðŸ‘‹*

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer specialized in Developer Tools. I work on [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), an end-to-end browser testing framework.

Previously, I worked at [Netlify](https://github.com/netlify) on all things developer-facing; built a job-queueing solution called [Quirrel](https://quirrel.dev/) (sold to Netlify); and received a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de/) near Berlin.

Iâ€™m the author of the popular [SuperJSON library](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson), was part of the [React 18 Working Group](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18), and contributed to projects like [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pulls?q=author:Skn0tt), [Apache Traffic Server](https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/pulls?q=author:Skn0tt) and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/44787).

I write about my work at [simonknott.de](https://simonknott.de).

Outside my profession, I enjoy woodworking, all kinds of design, cooking and cycling. Iâ€™m based in Berlin. [Reach out](mailto:coffee-with@simonknott.de) if you want to have a coffee!
